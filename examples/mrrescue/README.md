About Mr. Rescue
----------------

Mr. Rescue is an arcade styled 2d action game centered around evacuating civilians from burning buildings.

The game features fast paced fire extinguishing action, intense boss battles, a catchy soundtrack and lots of throwing people around in pseudo-randomly generated buildings.

As of version 1.02 we have added XBox 360 controller support and fullscreen modes.

How to run the game
-------------------

To run Mr. Rescue you will need the awesome LÖVE framework.

You can download LÖVE for free at http://love2d.org  
It only takes a minute.

Most Linux distributions also have LÖVE in their software repository.  
Search for "love" or "love2d".

If you have LÖVE installed simply double-click the .love file to run the game.  
If you retrieved the source code directly, just zip the whole folder and change the extension to .love.

How to play
-----------

We highly recommend checking out the ingame how-to but here’s the basics:  
* Your job is to rescue civilians from a burning building.
* You rescue people by picking them up and throwing them out the window.
* Equipped with a water gun you must fight your way through flames and fire sprites but remember: your job is to rescue people!
* When being near fire your suit will accumulate heat. Collect coolants to keep it from overheating.
* You water tank only has limited capacity. Emptying it will make you water gun overheat so watch your water usage.
